          <h3 class="text-secondary">What is permutation</h3>
          <p>Depending on the arrangement's order, a permutation is any combination of all or a portion of a collection
            of items.</p>
          <p>Consider a group of three letters, such as A, B, and C. How many different ways are there to arrange the
            two letters in the set? Every potential configuration would serve as an illustration of a permutation. The
            whole range of combinations would include AB, AC, BA, BC, CA, and CB.</p>
          <p>The vocabulary used by statisticians when discussing permutations is particular. Permutations are defined
            as n different things taken r at a time. R stands for the number of items used to create the permutation,
            and n stands for the number of objects used to create the permutation. Think about the illustration from the
            preceding sentence. The letters used to create the permutations were A, B, and C, which makes n = 3 and r =
            2 respectively.</p>
          <p>Because the sequence in which items are chosen important, AB and BA are regarded as two permutations. The
            main difference between a combination and a permutation is this. A combination emphasises the selection of
            things without respect for their selection in any particular order. In contrast, a permutation concentrates
            on how the things are ordered in relation to the order in which they are placed. Conclusion: AB and BA only
            represent one combination, but two permutations.</p>
          <h3 class="text-secondary">What is combination</h3>
          <p>A combination is a selection of all or a portion of a group of items, regardless of the sequence in which
            the items are chosen.</p>
          <p>Consider a group of three letters, such as A, B, and C. How many different ways are there from that
            collection for us to choose two letters? Every option would serve as an illustration of a combination. The
            whole range of choices would include AB, AC, and BC.</p>
          <p>The vocabulary used by statistics when discussing combinations in particular. Combinations are described as
            n different items taken r at a time. N stands for the number of things that make up the combination, and r
            stands for the number of objects that were employed to create it.</p>
          <p>Think about the illustration from the preceding sentence. A, B, and C were the three letters used to create
            the combinations, thus n = 3; each combination had two letters, so r = 2.</p>
          <p>Because the sequence in which the objects are chosen is irrelevant, AB and BA are regarded as one
            combination. The main difference between a combination and a permutation is this. A combination emphasises
            the selection of things without respect for their selection in any particular order. In contrast, a
            permutation concentrates on how things are ordered in relation to the order in which they are placed.
            Conclusion: AB and BA only represent one combination, but two permutations.</p>
          <h4>How many combinations?</h4>
          <p>A combination is a choice of all or a portion of a group of items, regardless of the sequence in which they
            were chosen. As a result, ZYX and XYZ are regarded as the same combination.</p>
          <p>nCr stands for the number of combinations of r items that may be chosen from a collection of n objects. And
            this is how you calculate that number:</p>
          <p><strong>nCr = (n - 1)(n - 2)... (n - r + 1)/r! = (n - r + 1)/r!(n - r)!</strong></p>
          <p>n! in the formula above stands for n factorial, and it equals n(n-1)(n-2)... (3)(2). (1).</p>
          <h4>How do you count the number of permutations?</h4>
          <p>In terms of the sequence in which the objects were chosen, a permutation is the selection of all or a
            portion of a collection of objects. This indicates that XYZ is regarded as a distinct permutation from ZYX.
          </p>
          <p>nPr stands for the number of permutations of r objects that may be chosen from a collection of n objects.
            And this is how you calculate that number:</p>
          <p><strong>nPr = n(n-1)(n-2)... (n-r + 1) = n! / (n-r)!</strong></p>
          <p>n! in the formula above stands for n factorial, and it equals n(n-1)(n-2)... (3)(2). (1).</p>
          <h4>What is the difference between a combination and a permutation?</h4>
          <p>The order or sequence in which things occur is what distinguishes a combination from a permutation. A
            combination emphasizes the selection of things without respect for their selection in any particular order.
            In contrast, a permutation focuses on how things are ordered in relation to the order in which they are
            placed.</p>
          <p>Think about the letters A and B, for instance. We can make the two 2-letter permutations AB and BA using
            those letters. AB and BA are distinct permutations because order matters to a permutation. However, since
            the order is irrelevant to a combination, AB and BA only represent one combination.</p>
          <h4>What is E Notation?</h4>
          <p>E notation is used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinations_and_permutations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Combinations and Permutations</a> Calculator to represent extremely huge values. For
            quantities that are either too big or too little to be expressed succinctly in decimal format, e notation is
            used.</p>
          <p>The letter E in E notation stands for "times 10 increased to the power of." Here is an illustration of a
            number in E notation:</p>
          <p><strong>3.02E+12 = 3.02 * 1012 = 3,020,000,000,000</strong></p>

          <h4>How to Use the nPr Calculator to Determine the Number of Permutations</h4>
          <p>Take a look at the steps below to see how this number permutation calculator works to get quick results for
            the inputs you enter:
            Inputs:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Choose the elements' names first.</li>
            <li>Enter the total number of items after that.</li>
            <li>Enter the number of elements you wish to choose right after that.</li>
            <li>Choose the finding parameter from the dropdown menu after that.</li>
            <li>Enter the element values next.</li>
            <li>Then, press the calculate button.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Outputs: <br>
            The permutation formula calculator displays: once you press the calculate button.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Permutation </li>
            <li>repetition and permutation</li>
            <li>a methodical computation</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Note: <br>
            Simply choose the calculation parameter from the dropdown menu, and the permutations calculator will reveal
            the outcome based on the input you have chosen.
          </p>
          <h4>Why could one utilize permutation?</h4>
          <p>It is employed in mathematics and practically all scientific disciplines. It is used in computer science
            for sorting algorithms, in physics for describing particle states, and in biology for describing RNA
            sequences.</p>
          <h4>How are permutations done?</h4>
          <p>The order is the only distinction between a combination and a permutation. While we don't worry about the
            ordering of the components in combinations, we do care about it in permutations. As an illustration, if you
            input 8574 when the locker's pin code is 4587, it won't open since the numbers are in a different order.</p>
          <h4>Last Words:</h4>
          <p>Calculations involving permutations occur in many different scientific domains and are easily understood by
            students in grades K–12. The online permutation calculator can determine the permutations of values in small
            or even big datasets, and it does it in a couple of seconds.</p>
