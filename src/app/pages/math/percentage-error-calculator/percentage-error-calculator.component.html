      <div class="row border shadow bg-white my-4">
        <div class="col-md-12 mx-2 my-4">
          <p>Let's use this calculator to figure out how much difference there is between your estimate and the actual
            number. Rather than computing a number each time, we frequently choose to guess it. We created this %
            mistake calculator for you, and it will enhance your calculations and estimations. When you've previously
            utilized the projected value in complex computations, this % error calculator comes in useful.</p>
          <h2 class="text-secondary">What is the percent error?</h2>
          <p>Percent error, also known as percentage error, is a measure of a measurement's accuracy relative to a real
            or estimated value, also known as a "theoretical" value. Unlike absolute error, which is reported in
            whatever units are used to measure it, percent error is expressed in percentages, which makes it much easier
            to discuss and grasp the magnitude of the error without knowing anything else. Using only the relative
            mistake, such as 1/100, is less handy than mentioning the 1% error. Our % error calculator can help you
            easily calculate it.</p>
          <h3>Percent error</h3>
          <p>For example, if I advise you that the absolute measurement error is 500 grammes, you are unsure if this is
            a significant or little change in relation to what you are measuring. If you were measuring weights in a
            market, say, selling potatoes, a 500 gramme (0.5 kilogramme or around 1 pound) inaccuracy would be fairly
            substantial, since the percentage error from a 2kg (4 pounds) bag of potatoes would be 25%, and you would
            not be permitted to sell scales with such a large potential error.</p>
          <p>However, 500 grammes is a common inaccuracy in many home scales designed to measure your body weight,
            because 0.5kg is just 1% for a 50kg man (110lbs) and 0.5% for a 100kg (220lbs) man - enough for the purpose.
            As a result, the same absolute error produces radically different % errors, illustrating its utility.</p>
          <p>Percent error should not be confused with standard deviation (of the sample), standard error (of the mean),
            or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">margin of error</a>, as these are more sophisticated statistical concepts.</p>
          <h3>Using the percent error calculator</h3>
          <p>Simply enter the observed value from any particular measurement or observation into our calculator, and
            then supply the correct value, if known. If it is unknown, put the best approximation you have. The relative
            error calculator will then calculate the mistake as a percentage, either positive or negative, based on the
            direction of the observed deviation from the real number.</p>
          <h3>Percentage Error Calculator:</h3>
          <p>This explains how to manually compute % inaccuracy. You'll be glad to hear that you have access to a
            calculator that strives to make calculations really easy and quick. You no longer need to bother about
            solving the equation to obtain the results. You can do so in the blink of an eye. You must have data that
            can be entered into the calculator.</p>
          <p>Using a percent error calculator makes it extremely simple to determine percent error. When you enter the
            data in the appropriate slots and then click the calculate button, calculating the % inaccuracy is really
            fast. The % error would be calculated automatically using a percent error calculator, and the result would
            be shown on the screen.</p>
          <h3>What are percent of Error, standard error and margin of error?</h3>
          <p>In layman's terms, a percentage mistake is also known as a relative error. It is the difference between a
            true and observed value. The true value is the one evaluated without any observation. The observed value, on
            the other hand, is one that is determined following an practical observation.</p>
          <p>If you think it takes 30 minutes to walk one kilometre, that is the real value. Similarly, if you walk 1km
            and determine that a time period of 25 minutes is required, it is the observed value. The relative error
            will be determined by dividing the difference between the true and observed values by the true value. The
            result will then be multiplied by 100.</p>
          <h3>Standard of Error</h3>
          <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error#:~:text=The%20standard%20error%20(SE)%20of,of%20the%20mean%20(SEM)." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard of error</a> is calculated for the entire sample rather than for a single number. The standard of
            error value reflects how correctly a fixed sample represents the entire population.</p>
          <h3>Margin of Error</h3>
          <p>In layman's terms, the margin of error is expressed as
            Margin of Error = Standard Error multiplied by Z Score MarginofError=StandardofErrorÃ—ZScore
            The determination of confidence intervals is linked to the margin of error.
          </p>
          <h3>Percent error formula</h3>
          <p>The % error formula can be written in a variety of ways. The most obvious example, assuming V stands for
            Value:</p>
          <p><strong>Percentage error = (Vobserverd - Vtrue) / Vtrue x 100</strong></p>
          <p>When computed, as shown above, the percentage error will be positive when the observed value is greater
            than the true, and negative otherwise, therefore knowing the sign of the error will help you determine the
            direction of the error. It is important to note that in chemistry and most disciplines, the direction of the
            mistake is important. Negative mistakes will be displayed with a minus sign in front of the percentage.</p>
          <p>The formula is expressed in some places as (Vtrue - Vobserverd), which is inaccurate or at least awkward
            because it flips the sign. If you don't care about the error's direction, just use the absolute: |Vobserverd
            - Vtrue| in the numerator.
            If you used the formula below to compute the absolute error:
          </p>
          <p><strong>Vobserverd - Vtrue = Eabsolute</strong></p>
          <p>The percent error formula may thus be written as follows:</p>
          <p><strong>Eabsolute / Vtrue x 100 = Percentage error</strong></p>
          <p>If you are aware of the relative error:</p>
          <p><strong>(Vobserverd - Vtrue) / Vtrue = Erelative</strong></p>
          <p>The % inaccuracy is then simply:</p>
          <p><strong>Erelative x 100 = Epercentage</strong></p>
          <p>As you can see, there are several methods for calculating it, but the math is basic enough that it can be
            done by hand in many circumstances.</p>
          <h2 class="text-secondary">How to calculate percent error?</h2>
          <p>Here are some examples utilising various beginning points and measurement systems. Our calculator may be
            used to check all of them.</p>
          <h3>Example 1: Percentage error from observed and true value</h3>
          <p>Consider an example from ordinary life. Assume you're buying wooden laths to build a treehouse. You order
            laths that are 10 feet (304.8 cm) long, but when they arrive, they are 10 feet 1 inch (307.34 cm) long. What
            is the percentage error?</p>
          <p>You must use the following formula:</p>
          <p><strong>(10 feet 1 inch - 10 feet) / 10 feet x 100 = (121 inches - 120 inches) / 120 inches x 100 = 1 / 120
            </strong></p>
          <p><strong>inches x 100 = 0.0083 inches x 100 = 0.83% mistake</strong></p>
          <h3>Example 2: Converting absolute inaccuracy to percent error</h3>
          <p>Return to our scales example from paragraph one. If we know our home scale's allowable absolute mistake is
            0.5kg (1.1 pound), how do we compute the percent inaccuracy if we estimate our accurate weight to be 100kg
            (220 lbs)?</p>
          <p>In kg, divide 0.5 by 100 to obtain the relative error, then multiply by 100 to get the percent. In pounds,
            divide 1.1 by 220 to obtain the relative error, then multiply by 100 to get the percent.</p>
          <p><strong>In kg: (0.5 / 100) Ã— 100 = 0.005 * 100 = 0.5% mistake</strong></p>
          <p><strong>In lbs: (1.1 / 220) Ã— 100 = 0.005 * 100 = 0.5% mistake</strong></p>
          <h3>Example 3: Absolute to percentage error</h3>
          <p>Let's return to the treehouse scenario, but with a twist. Now, when you purchase, the manufacturer informs
            you that a variance of up to 0.5 inches (12.7 mm) from your specification is to be expected owing to the
            manufacturing process. What is the percentage error?</p>
          <p>To do so, you must first determine the needed route length, such as 10 feet (304.8 cm). Then, use the
            calculation based on known absolute error as follows:</p>
          <p><strong>0.5 inch / 10 feet x 100 = 0.5 inch / 120 inches x 100 = 0.00416 x 100 = 0.416% percentage
              mistake</strong></p>

          <h3>Fundamental Assumption for % Error:</h3>
          <p>The fundamental assumption for calculating Percent error is that the subject is given correct values. In
            order to advance, he must be informed of the accepted or actual worth. However, there are some instances
            where the real value is unknown. </p>
          <p>In those circumstances, you need not be concerned. You still have the option of calculating the percentage
            of mistake. So, how do you determine the percentage error?</p>
          <p>In such cases, when real data are unavailable, the standard deviation might be useful. It makes it easier
            for the mathematician to represent the inaccuracy.</p>
