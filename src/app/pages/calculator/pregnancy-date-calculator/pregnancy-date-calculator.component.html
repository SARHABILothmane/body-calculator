          <p>"How old am I currently?" is a good place to start. Please consult our chronological age calculator for any
            questions
            you may have, such as "How old were I upon the date?" or "How old can I be in 2050?"</p>
          <p>In order to answer your age-related inquiries, you may pick from several time units (from milliseconds to
            years) in the precise age calculator:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How old am I?</li>
            <li>It's been how many days since my birth.</li>
            <li>How old am I, exactly?</li>
            <li>There are a few weeks left in my pregnancy.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>As soon as you've figured out your chronological age, don't forget to have a look at how old your dog or
            cat or pet bird is in human years.</p>
          <h2 class="text-secondary">How old am I?</h2>
          <p>The length of time that anything has existed is referred to as its age.</p>
          <p>When a person is born, they are said to be at an age. The gestational age refers to the period between
            conception and birth (the age of a pregnancy is counted from conception).</p>
          <p>A newborn is considered to be one year old on the first anniversary of their birth in the majority of
            countries throughout the globe. However, age is reckoned differently in certain countries (especially in
            Korea), such as the United States. Here, we'll stick with a system that is widely used.</p>
          <p>Find out how old you really are by using the age calculator we've provided below.</p>
          <h2 class="text-secondary">Today, I'm how old? Use an online chronological age calculator to find out your
            age.</h2>
          <p>What year were you born? Use the age calculator and enter your date of birth to see how old you are now:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Enter the date of your birth into the age calculator's first box. Input the first three letters of the
              month's name, day, comma, and year (e.g. "Oct 1, 1996"), or use the calendar icon to choose a date from
              the drop-down menu.</li>
            <li>Setting the time of your birth in advanced mode allows you to know your actual age in "tiny" units
              (e.g., how old am I in seconds?). In the absence of a date, the age calculator will begin counting from
              midnight on the day of your birth.</li>
            <li>The date is now set to "today" in the calculator's third input box. Let's just leave it at that if
              you're curious about how old you currently are.</li>
            <li>You may answer a variety of questions by selecting the appropriate unit of measurement (e.g., "How old
              am I in months?" "How old am I in weeks?" "How old am I in seconds?").</li>
            <li>A person's chronological age is determined by adding up all of the days and nights since birth,
              including the present moment.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you choose "years/months/days," the outcome will be accurate. Assume that one month has passed since
            the first month's selected date and that the second month's chosen date will be the same as the first
            month's (e.g., 22.02 to 22.03). If you choose "months," we'll suppose that each month has an average of
            30.4375 days. We don't take leap years into account when using the "years" option.</p>
          <h2 class="text-secondary">What year were you born? The date of birth is used to determine one's age.</h2>
          <p>After that, we'll learn how to do it ourselves, without the use of a computerized age calculator.</p>
          <p>Let's imagine you were born on December 5, 2000, and today is January 15, 2021. Let's go back in time and
            make a tally:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Begin with the day of your birth. Retrace your steps backwards in time and see how many more years you
              have left till your previous birthday:</li>
            <li>5.12.2020 was your most recent birthday. The years may be omitted:</li>
            <li>5.12.2020 minus 5.12.2000 is equal to 20 years.</li>
            <li>We've arrived at 5.12.2020. Try to add as many complete months to your timeline as possible, but don't
              go too far into the future (stop before you reach today).</li>
            <li>After one month of forward movement, we arrive at 5.01.2021 if this example is followed, hence we must
              halt time travelling in months.</li>
            <li>Add the days that are left. The year is 2021, and the date is 5.01.2021. We may simply deduct the
              number of days till the end of the month:</li>
            <li>10 days: 15 January 2021 - 5 January 2021</li>
            <li>Assume you've completed steps 1 through 3. It is going to be two decades and ten days</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="text-secondary">How old am I in terms of days, weeks, months, or years?</h2>
          <p>If you've ever thought to yourself, "How old am I?" How old am I in seconds? How old am I in days? This
            calculator may be able to answer these questions for you!</p>
          <p>Enter your date of birth, make sure you have today's date in the second box, then choose the chosen unit
            in the last field of the age calculator to see how old you are in various units.</p>
          <h2 class="text-secondary">When will I be in my mid-twenties?</h2>
          <p>Future dates are counted the same way as prior dates. You must update the "Calculate age on" box from the
            current date to the future date in order to use the age calculator.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If your birthday is March 4, 2005, you were born on this day. How old will you be in 2050 if you're
              wondering?</li>
            <li>Set your birth date (you can type in "Mar 4, 2005").</li>
            <li>"Jan 1, 2050" or "any other day in 2050" should be followed by "Calculate age on."</li>
            <li>You'll be 44 years, 9 months, and 28 days old on the first of the year in 2050, according to the
              online calculator.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="text-secondary">How old are you if you were born in 1999?</h2>
          <p>To get an approximation of someone's age if you don't know their precise birthday, subtract their birth
            year from the current year (you can be off by one year either side).</p>
          <p>For example, on January 10, 2021, it is 10.01.2021. Subtract a few years:</p>
          <p>2021 minus 1999 equals 22.</p>
          <p>In other words, if you were born in 1999, you'll be about 22 years old in 2021. However, if you were born
            after 10.01 UTC on January 1st of this year, you will be officially 21 years old on that day. In the
            perspective of the law, you'd be 21 at that point.</p>
          <h2 class="text-secondary">Exactly how many days are there in 15 years?</h2>
          <p>A simple way to find out how old you are if you're 15 is to input your birth date and the date you're
            looking for into the age calculator. Then, choose "days" as the unit of time.</p>
          <p>Use our time unit converter or enter two dates that are 15 years apart into our age calculator to convert
            15 years to days. There are 5479 days between "Jan 1, 2000" and "Jan 1, 2015."</p>
          <p><span>As an example - "At the time of this event, I was a...</span></p>
          <p>When did I first realise that time is a relative concept?"</p>
          <p>Opened a random page and discovered your journal, which had been stashed in the attic.</p>
          <p>"3.02.1978</p>
          <p>There will never be another day like this.. I used to believe that time was like a horizontal line that
            ran from left to right. As far as I know, it's always the same, no matter where you are or what time of
            day it is. That's what Mr. Brown told me today, and I'm going to take his word for it!"</p>
          <p>Your progress has been rapid, but not sufficient. You've aged so swiftly, and it's hard to believe.
            You've begun to wonder, "How old was I on this date?".. With little time to spare, you use our
            chronological age calculator instead.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You type in your birth date. Suppose you were born on April 25, 1962.</li>
            <li>Please enter the following date from your journal: 3.02.1978. Thanks for your time (or type in "Feb 3,
              1978").</li>
            <li>It came back that you were 15 years, 9 months, and 8 days old...</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="text-secondary">Count how many days I've been alive.</h2>
          <p>To figure out how old you are in days, use the following formula:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Take the number of years since your last birthday and divide it by 365.</li>
            <li>If you were born on September 15th, the first full month will expire on October 15th if 31 complete
              months have elapsed since your previous birthday.</li>
            <li>Find out how many days have passed since the previous full month.</li>
            <li>How many leap years have you seen in your life thus far? (every year that divides by four).</li>
            <li>All of the aforementioned numbers should be tallied.</li>
            <li>For the months of April, June, September, and November, deduct one, and for the month of February,
              deduct three.</li>
            <li>Congratulations on your birthday, and have a wonderful day!</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="text-secondary">Three years have how many months?</h2>
          <p>There are exactly 36 months in a three-year period. It doesn't matter whether or not it's a leap year,
            every year has the same number of months: 12.</p>
          <h2 class="text-secondary">if I've been alive for 10,000 days, how old am I?</h2>
          <p>138 or 139 days have passed since your twenty-seventh birthday, making your age 27. It all relies on the
            number of leap years that have previously gone (the month of February, to be specific). Alternatively, we
            may refer to you as 27 years, 4 months, and between 15 and 19 days of age (depending on which months have
